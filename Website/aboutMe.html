		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<h2>Sarah Hyun. Dog mom. Yarn enthusiast.</h2>
		<div class="body">
			<p>My first piece I crocheted ended up looking like an amorphic chicken embryo. It wasn't the best looking project, but it got me started. I was around 8 years old. After countless hours of watching youtube videos and experimenting on my own, I realized my love for the craft. I am particularly interested in home decor. I am a firm believer in unlimited amount of soft blankets and pillows to create the ultimate cozy piece of heaven to call your own. The yarn projects I make are inspired by my own love for comfort, calm, and peace in the home, and of course, my dog. I'm just any other girl, working a full time job to support my furbaby. I love to explore new places, play music, eat great food, and make some cool yarn creations along the way. I live an average life in the most fulfilling way I know how.</p>
