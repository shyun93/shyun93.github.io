					<p1>I've never really understood the concept of investing in your home. After all, all I needed was a bed to sleep on, eat on, to watch tv on, etc. I also never understood the importance of having a separate space for sleep. After moving into my one bedroom apartment, I made sure to really differentiate the bedroom and living room space, but at the same time, making both spaces as cozy as possible. I love my couch. I love having a specific space where I can unwind, drink a glass of wine and watch Grey's Anatomy. And as much as I could totally sleep on this couch every night, having my bed to crawl into at the end of the day makes my nights rest 100% better. (I'll do a separate post on my bedroom). This is my safe space and land of comfort. I filled it with the things I love. What do I love? Pillows. I love pillows. My couch is from <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S99150750/">IKEA</a>, and this couch was a perfect buy for my budget. Although I didn't splurge on a super nice couch from West Elm, I did fill it with fluffy, soft, pillows that made it feel just as luxurious. Don't worry, I'm still growing the pillow collection.</p1>

				<p1>I love having multiple options, different textures, and patterns to mix up my simple color palette. My favorite fabric to use is linen. All my pillow covers and shams are from my favorite home essentials store, Parachute Home. Their fabrics are all natural, oeko-tex certified, and just the softest fabric you will touch. Click <a href="https://parachutehome.com">HERE</a> and take a look! Oh! And of course, Ollie approves.</p1>
